### **Project Cost Estimate:**

Project cost estimation is the process of predicting the quantity, cost, and price of the resources required by the scope of a project. Since cost estimation is about the prediction of costs rather than counting the actual cost, a certain degree of uncertainty is involved.

### **Time Management Gantt Chart:**

A milestone chart is a horizontal chart that marks the most important steps of the project. Each milestone the team achieves brings you closer to completing the project. Besides keeping the team motivated, a milestone chart is also a great way to show project stakeholders how the project is progressing.
