# B. PROJECT PLANNING
### **Project Management Life-Cycle:**

The project management life cycle is usually broken down into four phases: initiation, planning, execution, and closure. These phases make up the path that takes your project from the beginning to the end. Figure below shows Work Breakdown Structure according to four phase.

A tree structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes, where each node is a data structure consisting of a value and a list of references to nodes. The start of the tree is the "root node" and the reference nodes are the "children". No reference is duplicated and none points to the root. Figure below shows Tree-structured Work Breakdown Structure according to five phase.

### **Risk Identification Chart:**

Risk identification is the process of determining risks that could potentially prevent the program, enterprise, or investment from achieving its objectives.

Control Element	| What is likely to go wrong?	| How and when will I know?	| What will I do about it?
--- | --- | --- | ---
Quality	| The system unable to identify the similarity of trademark accurately | When we do test	| We train our system and increase the data set until satisfactory result is determined
Cost	| Expensive equipment to run the system	| When the cost needed is higher than the predicted cost at the beginning of the project	| Increase the amount of the budget
Time	| Take time to collect and train the data	| Time for training process longer than expected and sometimes with error	| Train data using GPU instead of CPU or cloud computing

### **Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM):**

A responsibility assignment matrix, also known as RAM or linear responsibility chart, describes the participation by various roles in completing tasks or deliverables for a project or business process.

### **Team Responsibility:**

Team Member	| Role	| Responsibilities
--- | --- | ---
Nahvin Muthusamy	| Project Manager	| Overseer the entire project from beginning until completion.
Muhammad Zaid Aqil Bin Waheed Rahman	| System Engineer	| Assessing systems, determining problems, providing solutions to issues that arise, designing systems, upgrading systems, maintaining systems and brainstorming possible improvements that can be made to a system in the future.
Nik Nor Alifah Ilyana binti Abd Malik	| Test Manager	| Planning, coordination and control of test activities, development and definition test methods and test tools.

### **Budget Planning:**

Modules/Components	| Budget	| Schedule	| Responsibility
--- | --- | --- | ---
Entire Project	| RM 1 000 000	| 04/10/2021 - 14/01/2022	| Data Collection, Model Training, User Interface, System Functionality
