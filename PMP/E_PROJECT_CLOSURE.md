# E. PROJECT CLOSURE
### **Customer Acceptance Form:**

An Acceptance Form helps to gain acceptance from the customer that what have produced meets their needs. An Acceptance Form lists all of the Acceptance Criteria for gaining their approval, and it documents the results of any acceptance testing carried out. In this case, our customer is ***MyIPO Corporation***.

### **Close Contract:**

A contract is a legally enforceable agreement between two parties for goods or services. Closing a contract means legally ending the contract before both parties have fulfilled their obligations under the terms of the contract.
