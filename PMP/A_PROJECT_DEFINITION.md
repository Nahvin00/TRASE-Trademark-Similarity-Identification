# A. PROJECT DEFINITION
### **Project Name:**
TRASE: Trademark Similarity Identification System


### **Project Summary:**
Trademarking is not a simple task, because it requires not only a unique name but also the approval of the board. Some companies find it hard to trademark due to the long time and tedious process it takes to trademark anything. Also, there are problems of others trying to copy or mimic your brand logo or name. Therefore, we have decided to make it easier for other companies to register themselves through this project.

Thus, each company has its uniqueness to itself. With this in mind, we can build according to the uniqueness of the company. The way different combinations of words have different sounds, we have analysed it and used it to our advantage. Where others can profit off a companies branding we will have a system to stop them for building on  other brands. With mapping the words on a graph we are able to detect the similarity of the pronunciation and avoid fakes being approved.
